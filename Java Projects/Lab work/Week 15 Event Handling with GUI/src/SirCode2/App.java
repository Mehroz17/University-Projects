		//How to handle events in Java Swing?
		//for now, we will be focusing on button click event
		
		//event? //as a result of user interaction with the components of container, we expect components to do something
		//container, components (labels, text fields, frame, etc.....) they are actually objects
		//every object has a state and when that state changes, it is called an event
		//this change is as a result of user interaction with the components, container, etc...
		//when events occur, then they need to be handled
		//events (user interaction - foreground), (not user interaction - background - system, OS)
		
		//1. event (button click)
		//handling events in Java (there are 2 things)
		// 1. identify the source of event 2. You need to connect the source with the handler
		
		//three ways to handle the event 
		//1. using a separate class
		//2. within a class
		//3. inner class
		//4. anonymous class

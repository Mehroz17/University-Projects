   How to handle events in Java Swing?
   FOr now we will be focus on events of buttons click event

   What is Event?
   As a result os user interaction with the componet of container , we expect componnets to do something
   container, componnets (lables, text, frame,etc....) they are actually objects
   every object has a state and when that state is changes it is called an evnt.
   this change is as a result of user interaction with the components , containers etc..

   When hanlde occurs, then they need to be handled

   Events (user interaction- foreground) , (not user interaction - background- system, os)
            To hadle events we have 2 things: -
   * You nedd to identify the source of event (means from which button we have to do the taks)
   * You need to connect the source with the "handler".




                                Todays Event Handle
   1.Event Button Click:

       3 ways to handle events
             1. using a separet class (not a good way)
             2. with in the class   (not a goog idea)       //These are not fixed
             3. using inner classes (good idea)
             4. Anonymus class   (good idea)

    2.Key Event:
        it uses KeyListner interface
        it use 3 methods

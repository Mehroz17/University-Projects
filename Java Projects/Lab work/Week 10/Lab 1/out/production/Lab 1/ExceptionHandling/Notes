Definiton:
"The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to
handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained."


every software build by developers have some specific flow
The flow is developed by the developer.
Flow means:
What we want to enter and what will be the flow of the inputs and outputs.
Abnormal Flow:
To handle abnormal flows we use "Exceptions".
In software systems we have "events". Events means that from which we are getting input
1.button click , mouse click,
2. Method call


To handle Exceptions:
To abnormal flow ,use "Try ,catch" to handel exceptions
by default Java provides try and catch structure
we can have multiple catch statements
Types:
1.Uncheck Exception (in this compiler has no issues but we have run time issue with the input)
it is also called "run time exceptions"
